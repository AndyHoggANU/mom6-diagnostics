# mom6-panan-diagnostics

This repository contains code to analyse and diagnose results from the [MOM6 Pan-Antarctic Model](https://github.com/COSIMA/mom6-panan).

The model is a 1/20° regional model, covering all ocean regions south of 37°S. MOM6-SIS2 coupled configuration, forced at the open boundary by one year of daily output from ACCESS-OM2-01 RYF, and at the surface by JRA55v13 RYF. 

Diagnostic code relies on the [COSIMA cookbook](https://github.com/COSIMA/cosima-cookbook).
