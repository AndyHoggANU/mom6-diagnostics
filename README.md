# mom6-diagnostics

This repository contains code to analyse and diagnose results from recent MOM6-based COSIMA simulations, including:
* The [MOM6 Pan-Antarctic Model](https://github.com/COSIMA/mom6-panan). The model is a 1/20° regional model, covering all ocean regions south of 37°S. MOM6-SIS2 coupled configuration, forced at the open boundary by one year of daily output from ACCESS-OM2-01 RYF, and at the surface by JRA55v13 RYF.
* A JRA55-RYF based 0.25° simulation using GFDL's OM4 configuration.

Diagnostic code relies on the [COSIMA cookbook](https://github.com/COSIMA/cosima-cookbook).
